NumKinFit is a Python 3.7 based GUI program which can perform numerical integrations for kinetic models and   
also fit the model parameters to experimental measurements. It was developed to analyse kinetic measurements 
for gas phase reactions but could be easily used to study kinetic system of any phase. 

Detail instructions on using the model and some examples are provided in the USER_MANUAL pdf.
