Numkinfit is a Python 3.7 based GUI program which can numerically calculate concentrations of various species in 
a kinetic system. It can be used to do model simulations as well as fit parameters of the model to experimental 
measurements. It was developed to analyse kinetic measurements for gas phase reactions but could be easily used to 
study kinetic system of any phase. 

Detail instructions on using the model and some examples are provided in the USER_MANUAL pdf.
